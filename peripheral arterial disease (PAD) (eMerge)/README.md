## Phenotype Methodology
To define a ‘definite’ PAD case population, patients will meet the algorithmic vascular lab criteria in Section 1 or will have any of the two related codes or presence of indicative phrases in Sections 2-5. To define a ‘probable’ PAD case population for further investigation, patients will meet any one of the related codes or presence of indicative phrases in Sections 2-5.
