# Seizure Phenotype Definition

According to a Mini-Sentinel study, ICD10 codes used to identify Epilepsy are:  'G40.X','G40.0','G40.1','G40.2','G40.3','G40.4','G40.5','G40.6','G40.7','G40.8','G40.9','G41.X','G41.0','G41.1','G41.2','G41.8','G41.9','G43.1','G45.X','R55','R56.0','R56.8'. 
Patients with Epilepsy are classified with a subset of the following ICD10 codes: 
G40.0 Localization-related idiopathic epilepsy and epileptic syndromes n/a
G40.1 Localization-related symptomatic epilepsy and epileptic syndromes with
simple partial seizures
G40.2 Localization-related symptomatic epilepsy and epileptic syndromes with
complex partial seizures
G40.3 Generalized idiopathic epilepsy 
G40.4 Other generalized epilepsy n/a
G40.5 Special epileptic syndromes 11.1 
G40.6 Grand mal seizures, unspecified 
G40.7 Petit mal, unspecified n/a
G40.8 Other epilepsy n/a
G40.9 Epilepsy unspecific 
G41.0 Grand mal status epilepticus 100 
G41.1 Petit mal status epilepticus n/a
G41.2 Complex partial status epilepticus 
G41.8 Other status epilepticus 
G41.9 Status epilepticus, unspecified 

# Phenotype Methodology
To define a population of patients diagnosed with Seizures and Epilepsy the above ICD codes were used. For patients with Epilepsy a sample of patients that were defined as inpatient were used to define the validity of the ICD codes. A sample of inpatient and outpatient were used to define the validatiy of ICD codes for seizure.
